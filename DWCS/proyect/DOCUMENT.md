# THE MUSSEL ROUTE
During my summers, I have been working in **tourist travel companies**, so I decided to create this page using all the **knowledge** I acquired during that time.

The page will focus on the **Mussel Route**, provide information about the **boats**, and allow users to **book** their trips directly.

## **NAVIGATION**

On this page, **navigation** is quick and easy through the **left side menus**, where you can access:

- **Home page (HOME)**
- **Description (DESCRIPTION)**
- **Make a reservation (TAKE YOUR TICKET)**

When you log in, the option to **log out (LOGOUT)** will also appear, which will take you back to the home page. These options are present on **all pages**, except for the **login** and **purchase confirmation** pages.

Additionally, there will be **two buttons** that allow you to access the **login** and **purchase** pages. To proceed, it will be necessary to complete the **mandatory fields** in the form.

The last navigation element is the **end.php** file, which is a link that allows you to **log out** and return to the **home page (RETURN HOME)**.

## **PROJECT STRUCTURE**

![Project Structure](img/Tree.png)

The project structure is organized as follows:

- The **main files** of the pages, along with this document, are located in the **root directory** of the project.
- There are **3 folders** for storing CSS styles, images used on the pages, and PHP code fragments that are included on the pages.

### **CSS folder:**
All pages apply the **mainStyle.css**, which defines the **font**, **colors**, and the **layout of containers** like the menu, among others. The other CSS files are specific to other pages.

### **IMG folder:**
This is where the **images** used throughout the page are stored, as well as those used in this document.

### **Fragment folder:**
In this folder, you will find all the **included elements** for the PHP pages, such as the file that ends the session and redirects you to the home page (**logout.php**).
